The blogosphere has plenty to say about cloud computing, but most content targets the business, CIO, or IT crowds. Information exists for developers who want to produce software friendly to cloud computing, but it's more scattered, it's vendor-centric, and it doesn't match the SEO profile that obsesses much of the industry. As a result, I believe that many developers have only hazy ideas about how they can leverage the power of the cloud to provide radical improvements in scale, responsiveness, and connectivity for their customers.

This ought to change. Cloud computing isn't just interesting to datacenter managers; it enables many new technological strategies. Cloud-savvy engineering can boldly go where no software has gone before—if we're smart enough to take it there.

On my company's website, I've begun a new series of blog posts about how to "cloudify" your code and designs. Read the <a title=""Cloudify" series at Adaptive Computing" href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/blog-cloud/how-to-cloudify-your-software-part-1-enders-homework/" target="_blank">inaugural post</a>, and check back on Fridays for new installments in <a title="cloudify series" href="../../../category/cloudify">the series</a>. I'll be making connections back to concepts here on codecraft, such as what <a title="My First Tangle With the Tower of Babel" href="../../../2013/04/26/my-first-tangle-with-the-tower-of-babel/">the programming language of the future</a> ought to look like, how to <a title="Good fences make good neighbors" href="../../../2013/05/15/good-fences-make-good-neighbors/">encapsulate</a> for cloud, and so forth.

I believe that a competence with cloud--cloud-oriented programming, if you will--will be a checkbox on future tech resumes.
