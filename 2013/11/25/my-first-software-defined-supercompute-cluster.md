This week on the Adaptive Computing blog, I write about what it was like to start up a modest supercomputer on the Amazon cloud. <a title="supercompute on Amazon" href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/blog-cloud/my-first-software-defined-supercompute-cluster/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>...

But itâ€™s hard to beat the amazing flexibility of software-based clusters in the cloud. Photo credit: ESO (Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]
