      Customers handle their own anti-freeze, flsh bulbs, and lighter 
      fluid. If its taken you 5, 10 or 15 years to get into the condition youre in now, then trust me, a stroll just 
      isnt enough. While dragging on your screen with your mouse and holding 
      shift, you can pull the layer or selected object 45 degrees in any direction.

When you role play in <a href="role-play-centered-design.md">RPCD</a>, you could be standing in for either software, or a flesh-and-blood human being. As RPCD explicitly acknowledges, both are part of your final system.

A key insight of RPCD is that the distinction between these two entities is a lot less meaningful than we usually think. Most software is created to solve a problem that ordinary human beings are already addressing in some fashion. In fact, I might go so far as to say that this is true of all software. The quick exceptions that come to mind just take a little more pondering to map. Biometric scanners? Just a replacement for humans judging whether a person matches that photo on their driver's license. RFID tags? Just making the human inventory team's job easier. Firmware in high-speed switches on the internet backbone? Just a step or two removed from postmen and switchboard operators. Word processors and IMEs? Just a replacement for a transcriptionist. Signal analyzers for <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">SETI</a>? Genome sequencers? Protein folders for <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/English/HomePage" target="_blank">Folding@Home</a>? Just substitutes for human researchers.

Even if you're playing a role that you're sure will ultimately be encapsulated in a tidy software abstraction, RPCD helps you remember that the problem that entity solves is ultimately a <em>human</em> problem. We don't pay engineers the big bucks to make computers happy.
